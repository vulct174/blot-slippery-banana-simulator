> **Watch the Banana Mayhem Unfold!** A delightfully chaotic web app where users report their most ridiculous banana-related incidents, and AI transforms them into epic chronicles of slippery chaos.

## üé≠ What is This Madness?

The **Slippery Banana Simulator** is a whimsical web application that turns everyday banana mishaps into legendary tales of chaos. Users can report their banana-related incidents on Reddit, and every 8-15 minutes (with smart randomization), our AI bot generates dramatic, humorous narratives called **AI Banana Chronicles** and posts them back to the community.

Think of it as a collaborative storytelling experiment where human creativity meets AI imagination, all centered around the universal experience of... slipping on banana peels! üçå

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slippery-banana-simulator.git
cd slippery-banana-simulator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Reddit API (for bot functionality)
VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_app_client_id
VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_app_client_secret
VITE_REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/admin
VITE_REDDIT_USER_AGENT=SlipperyBananaBot/1.0

# Admin Panel Access
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=banana_admin_2025

# Server-side Environment Variables (for Edge Functions)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### 4. Database Setup

The app uses Supabase with the following tables:
- `banana_incidents` - Stores user-reported banana chaos
- `narratives` - AI-generated chronicles
- `reddit_auth` - OAuth tokens for bot authentication
- `bot_settings` - Configurable bot behavior

Run the included migrations to set up your database schema.

### 5. Reddit App Configuration

4. Copy the client ID and secret to your `.env` file

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the banana chaos unfold! üçå

For admin access, go to `http://localhost:5173/admin` and use your admin password.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern UI with hooks and functional components
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom banana theme
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons

### Backend & Services
- **Supabase** - Database, real-time subscriptions, and edge functions
- **Reddit API** - OAuth authentication and comment posting
- **Google Gemini AI** - Narrative generation with advanced prompting
- **Netlify** - Deployment and hosting

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### üîÑ **Smart Bot Intervals**
Instead of fixed timing, the bot uses randomized intervals (8-15 minutes) to feel more natural and avoid detection as spam.

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling**
Multiple fallback systems ensure the app works even when external APIs are down:
- Reddit API ‚Üí Cached data
- Supabase ‚Üí Local storage
- Gemini AI ‚Üí Graceful degradation

#### üîê **Secure Authentication**
Reddit OAuth tokens are stored securely in Supabase with automatic refresh handling.

#### üìä **Real-time Data Flow**
```
Reddit Comments ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí React UI
                     ‚Üì
              Gemini AI ‚Üí Narratives ‚Üí Reddit Posts
```

## üé® Customization

### Banana Themes
The app includes a custom Tailwind theme with banana-inspired colors:
- Primary: Various shades of yellow/gold
- Accent: Brown for that authentic banana peel look
- Success: Green for fresh bananas

### Bot Personality
Modify the AI prompts in `supabase/functions/generate-narrative/index.ts` to change the bot's storytelling style.
